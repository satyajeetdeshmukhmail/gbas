hi i am working as a deputy manager-desktop application development i am handling team of gui people where my job is to train,mentor,coding ,validation,testing,documentatiion,
vendor coordination from gui sotware perceptive i am in writing for goal settings this year with following agenda :
I.	Aim for this year – this should be measurable and very specific. No general statements please. Aim/tasks have to be project based – either NPD or execution.   
II.	Activities/milestones to be completed – this has to be time bound. Assessment will be done on the basis of whether the committed task was done on, before or after the time committed. 
III.	One goal has to be process oriented – process which the individual will set up as part of his/her work
IV.	Learning & Development requirement – please include details of one training which you need 
and i will share you project plan as well give me detailed data to set my goal ->Emergency Manager module high-level software architecture
